1. Colour attributes for VICKY
2. Abstract memory model to
   a) Attach outside debugger
   b) Make VICKY look at real memory
3. Make own emulator
4. Investigate parenscript
5. Create VINEs, String tables etc
   Bytecode

   Bit 7 6 5 - 0  7 -  0
       0 0 0       n/a   - End of vine
       0 0 HI-ADD LO-ADD - Call proc (leave till needed)
       0 1 HI-ADD LO-ADD - Vine at address
       1 0 TABLE   n/a   - String table random
       1 1 HI-ADD LO-ADD - String at address

   Obviously this would be a lot more compact than a procedure which simply JSRs to
   render a bunch of strings, but yaggers.
