SEPTEMBER 2017

Given that there are only two days left of August I'm going to have the following goals.

i) Generic object examine
ii) Generic object take
iii) Generic object drop
iv) Adjective resolution (in other words, if there are two KEYS, choose the correct one if the adjective is supplied, otherwise display a message, e.g. You'll have to be more specific.
v) Ensure we can move between the locations of the test game correctly

Here is a whole bunch of stuff that needs to be done for the competition next year.
