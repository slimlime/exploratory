## 27/5/2017 Roundtrip encoding strings

Compressed strings can be added to the program with the assembler command dcs, e.g.

~~~~
(dcs :my-string "This is a string")
~~~~

After one full pass, all strings have been processed and a symbol table built. After a second pass, the strings can be encoded into literal bytes. There is a validation run which checks (in Lisp) that in theory the strings can all be decoded, but it would be nice to check that the 6502 routine for decoding actually does what it says on the tin.

~~~~
  (compile-string-test :test-str)

  (dolist (str *compiled-strings*)

    (compile-string-test (car str))
    (monitor-reset #x600)
    (monitor-run :print nil)

    (let ((*compiler-buffer* (monitor-buffer)))
      (let ((output 
	     (map 'string #'code-char
		  (subseq *compiler-buffer*
			  (resolve :str-buffer)
			  (position 0 *compiler-buffer* :start (resolve :str-buffer))))))
	(format t "~a~%" output)
	(assert (equal output (cdr str)))))))

This function compiles a string test program to 6502 once, and as a side-effect grabs the list of strings that were included. The test program contains a routine that simply emits encoded strings into a buffer. It then compiles and executes (using a monitor attached to a suitable emulator) the 6502 machine code, once for every string in the program. The buffer is then checked against the actual string to see if it matches.

As far as 'unit' tests go, this is as perfect as it gets; for the simple reason that the decoder will *never* be expected to handle any string that hasn't already been tested. It will encounter only the strings that have been explicitly built into the program.
