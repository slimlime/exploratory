# 6/6/2017 Justified ancient text

![Alt text](/muse.png)

The justification is pre-computed, following the principle of never doing at run-time what can be done at assembly time. Of course, this is often a space-time trade-off, but in this case it isn't. I did violate one rule, DRY, that is, the width calculation is done in LISP as well as in 6502. The text measurement could have been done by running the actual code, but then it is easy to take principles too far.

# 5/6/2017 Kerning has been achieved

Added a very basic kerning algorithm whereby a character can decide if it admits a character a pixel closer to the right, and a character can decide if it is such a character that can be admitted a pixel closer, to the left.

The extra code to decide whether to kern or not. The widths of all characters were reduced by one in the tables- the extra pixel is added back in when (in the vast majority of cases) the two adjacent characters do not kern together.

The more complex scheme where there are two classes of adjacency (over/under and sparseness) for kerning has not been implememnted, this is why the spacing of "hi" could be improved in the first typeface. I am pretty happy with the typesetting now so I will move on to text flow and then the exciting business of images, which will be compressed with a sliding-window algorithm, or a variant on the fixed width symbol. Since we are outputting the data into screen memory, sliding-window now becomes a possibility where it was not with the text- it is important to note that nowhere do we actually write out the strings to a memory in anything as vulgar as ASCII. That is for C programmers.

# 4/6/2017 Rendering test

So rendering from compressed strings in a variety of fonts is almost there. I wanted a certain feel to the game and variable width fonts were an absolute must. Since no-one is reading this blog, this screen shot will not give anything of the game away. The deadline for the IF competition is September, so that's a certain motivation, but it also means I won't be checking in the actual game data here until after.

Note the use of the faked 16 bit mnemonic.

## Kerning

I have an idea for a simple kerning algorithm. Each letter currently has its width measured by the assembler and leaves exactly one pixel between it and the next. In the length byte of the character data there is a nybble free.

- Admits an underloper to the right (e.g. f)
- Admits anyone to the right (e.g. the i in the gothic font)
- Admits anyone to the left (e.g. the t in the gothic font)
- Is an underloper (e.g. e, but not T)

The combination of these bits with the next characters kerning bits can then be used to generate a more pleasing spacing. For example, in the gothic font, f can overhang e by two pixels. These kerning flags will probably be set manually, but it may be possible to run a script to get a good first pass.

One thing I have learned so far in building and assembler for 6502 is that of the two important problems in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things, off-by-one errors are by far the most pernicious.

## Cache invalidation

Since the assembler is multi-pass, the operations have to be idempotent. Since this is a faff, there is now a flag *compiler-final-pass* which replaces the *compiler-ensure-labels-resolve*. This means that we can output invalid bytes, use dodgy addresses etc, until the final pass. Additionally, certain things will be no-ops, like adding to the list of strings present in the build- this only takes effect in the final pass to avoid non-idempotency issues.

## Naming things

Naming things is still a pain. I haven't found a nice way of naming 'parameters' to 'functions'. Zero page scratch is aliased inside the functions, but not outside. This will have to be solved as it is too easy to lose track of generically named zpg labels.

The other naming problem is the use of conses for namespaced labels, e.g '(:render . :some-label). This is pretty boring, but it seems to work so I am still sticking with it. The longer I leave it before declaring a function or reader macro, the harder it will be to change.

## OBOEs

Clear the carry, set the carry. Egads.

# 2/6/2017 Rendering an upside down G

## Flag and register value sneakery

6502 has no BRA. Sometimes we need a BRA, so

~~~~
(LDY 10 "10 pixel character height")
(BNE :go)
~~~~

Sneaky. 6502.org details a lot more of these kind of shenanighans.

For the font renderer, I have used Y as a counter to index into the character data. Counting down to zero is best, there's no comparison. Here I use the (supposedly rarely used) X indexed indirect zero page addressing mode without having to reach for the far more sensible Y indirect indexed mode, which would necessitate preserving the state of Y somewhere horrible like the stack.

~~~~
(DEX)
(BNE :shift-right)
(ORA.IZX :raster "Bam, free indirection into raster, since X is 0")
~~~~

Which leads me to the upside-downness of the G. Since we count down, we index from the top of the data. Boo. Rather than count up and do a wasteful and aesthetically displeasing CMP, we simply reverse the generated font data. Never do at run-time what can be done at assembly time. Especially when your runtime is 1Mhz and you don't even have an instruction to increment the accumulator.

## Label aliasing

Since the 6502 has basically no registers we use the zeropage in its place. So it is nice to define bytes and words for specific important uses (e.g. important global state), but it is also nice to use it for 'local variables' which may change from function to function. All this acheives is a nicer disassembly.

## First conceptual problem

The first hard problem has arisen. Consider the following snippet,

~~~~
(defun inc16.zp (label)
  "Increment a zero-page word"
  (INC.ZP (lo-add label))
  (BNE :end)
  (INC.ZP (hi-add label))
  (label :end))
~~~~

To the human eye, this looks reasonable, but since labels are placed into a global table, if you call this function twice, one instance will not know which end to call. Wrapping in a namespace doesn't help either. Now the problem is one of identifying the instance of the label from one pass to another, which is really the second problem in computer science. There's probably a way to resolve the labels using a fancy algorithm. Until I figure out what that is and if it is worth it, the first solution is,

~~~~
(defun inc16.zp (label)
  "Increment a zero-page word"
  (INC.ZP (lo-add label))
  (BNE 2)
  (INC.ZP (hi-add label)))
~~~~

Ultimate Yaggers- now I can continue with the font renderer.

# 31/5/2017 8 bit multiplication by 10

Let's say you have a bunch of characters that are 10 pixels high and you want to do a multiplication to look up the address of the bytes where you are keeping them. Well, the first step, I thought was to see if we can do multiplication *at all* on the 6502. Here is a new instruction, MUL10, which does it.

Having said that it will be pretty useless as we need a 16 bit address if we are to have any hope of rendering it to the screen.

Anyway, here is a function to multiply by 10, well actually a function that will emit some 6502 machine code to multiply by ten, followed by a function which does it, runs it through an emulator and checks that it actually works.

~~~~

  "Multiply A by ten, if 0 <= A <= 25"
  (zp-b :scratch)

  (STA.ZP :scratch)

    (LDA v)
    (MUL10)

	(funcall *monitor-get-state*)
      (declare (ignore buffer pc sp sr x y))
      (assert (= a (* v 10))))))

~~~~

Note the scratch reservation with zp-b, scratch is going to be a byte that may change at any time. Except in an interrupt, where we should probably take care not to use it. Because it is lisp and the compiler labels are variables, we can do this instead, though it is Yaggers atm.

# 30/5/2017 Label namespaces, VICKY and YAGNI

It would be nice to use the same generic names for labels when writing assembly language, e.g. next, done, start, end. To this end, I added namespaces. Using the macro with-namespace instructs the assembler to try to resolve all labels in the specified namespace. If it can't find one, it tries the global namespace. The label directive will apply the label to the currently active namespace unless told otherwise by an optional namespace parameter. This is useful for 'exposing' a label in the middle of a namespace block. Of course, it isn't really exposing anything, since it the label is available everywhere with its qualifier. The qualifier is added by consing it to the label; I will probably change this to something nicer if it gets in the way. If it doesn't get in the way then I won't, as it is YAGNI, which from now on will be referred to as yaggers.

## VICKY

VICKY (I was going to go for V.I.C.K.Y. Perhaps there's a movie in there somewhere about a regular schoolgirl who is actually a robot) is a view of an mmap'ed section of memory, rendered to the screen in the washed out palette of the VIC-II fromm the C64. This is giving the 6502 code something to target. For now, it will just render the hi-res bitmap mode, 320x200 which I plan on using for the adventure game.

Look, here is a test rendering I dumped in using a 'medieval' style font. Sadly I think that at 12 pixels high, it will be too big, there being room for only 15 lines (the original, 8-bit break on which it was based is even bigger). Note the horrific horizontal spacing- variable width rendering of fonts is next on the agenda. For some of you, the brown and yellow colour scheme will bring back memories redolent of languorous summers spent indoors waiting for tapes to load. I had a Spectrum, so I feel nothing. Perhaps resentment, not greatly dulled by time.

UPDATE - As you can see three additional fonts have been added, 10 pixels high. There are some flaws. But, meh, fix it when it needs fixing. It will be okay at the sanding stage.

# 27/5/2017 Roundtrip encoding strings

Compressed strings can be added to the program with the assembler command dcs, e.g.

~~~~
(dcs :my-string "This is a string")
~~~~

After one full pass, all strings have been processed and a symbol table built. After a second pass, the strings can be encoded into literal bytes. There is a validation run which checks (in Lisp) that in theory the strings can all be decoded, but it would be nice to check that the 6502 routine for decoding actually does what it says on the tin.

~~~~
  (compile-string-test :test-str)

  (dolist (str *compiled-strings*)

    (compile-string-test (car str))
    (monitor-reset #x600)
    (monitor-run :print nil)

    (let ((*compiler-buffer* (monitor-buffer)))
      (let ((output 
	     (map 'string #'code-char
		  (subseq *compiler-buffer*
			  (resolve :str-buffer)
			  (position 0 *compiler-buffer* :start (resolve :str-buffer))))))
	(format t "~a~%" output)
	(assert (equal output (cdr str)))))))
~~~~

This function compiles a string test program to 6502 once, and as a side-effect grabs the list of strings that were included. The test program contains a routine that simply emits encoded strings into a buffer. It then compiles and executes (using a monitor attached to a suitable emulator) the 6502 machine code, once for every string in the program. The buffer is then checked against the actual string to see if it matches.

As far as 'unit' tests go, this is as perfect as it gets; for the simple reason that the decoder will *never* be expected to handle any string that hasn't already been tested. It will encounter only the strings that have been explicitly built into the program.
